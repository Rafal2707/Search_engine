# Webserver - Search Engine Project for the IP Course (2021)
The aim of the project was to create a search engine that will work similarly to the Google search engine. You must configure the text file from which you want to search for individual terms. By default it is set to enwiki-medium.txt.
The engine recognizes page titles and lists all pages that contain a search term.
